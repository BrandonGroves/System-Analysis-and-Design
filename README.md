# System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was a new company called DriverPass. DriverPass hired us to design a system for them that would help people who are preparing to take their written and driving tests. This system would offer customers study materials, practice tests, and the ability to schedule driving hours with an instructor. This system would ultimately assist new drivers with passing their exams on the first try. Administrators would have unique abilities as well like for example, canceling any packages that DriverPass no longer would like to offer. 

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did good work when describing the technical requirements that went into developing DriverPass. In the end I know that all of my UML diagrams could be improved, but most of them were the first of their kind that I've ever created with Lucid Chart. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I struggled with creating my sequence diagram. When I finished with it, I knew that it wasn't my best work, but I didn't have enough time to research them. If I had I'm sure that my finished product would have reflected it. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the needs of DriverPass, I read thoroughly through the interview transcript. Everything they said that I could interpret as a deliverable, I wrote down. When I had a full list ready, I started to think about how those would be done via software or if they were external requirements. When I encountered abstract requirements like "security" generally, I relied on research to find the best solution. It is important to include the user's needs when designing because you want to build what was actually requested of you. You want the customer to be satisfied with what you deliver, so that they'll continue to bring you business and or referals for new customers.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When it comes to designing software, there are various approaches and techniques that can be used. I personally choose to follow a process model, such as the Waterfall model or agile methodologies. To analyze and design a system in the future, I would consider a combination of techniques. One technique is requirement gathering, where I would engage with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations. This coud involve conducting interviews, surveys, or workshops. Another technique is creating system models, such as use case diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams, to visualize the system's structure and behavior. 
Additionally, I would consider prototyping, which involves building small-scale versions of the system to gather feedback and refine the design. This iterative appproach helps in identifying and addressing potential issues early on. Lastly, I would prioritize usability, performance, and security as key factors in the design process to ensure a high-quality and user-friendly system. By utilizing these techniques and strategies, I aim to create effective and efficient software systems that meet the needs of users and stakeholders.
